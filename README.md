Movie captions:

### Movie S1

Optimal 5-state sensing network with 4 signaling states (blue) and one nonsignaling state (gray) as a function of energy consumed per binding event.
*Left:*  Graphical representation of sensing network as energy per binding event is increased.  Radius of circles is proportional to the steady state density in that state, while graph edge width is proportional to the steady state flux between states.  *Right:*  Scaled estimator uncertainty as a function of energy consumed per binding event.  Vertical line indicates the point on this plot that corresponds to the current graph on the left.  

### Movie S2

Optimal sensing networks of sizes 3 through 9, all with one nonsignaling state, as energy consumption is increased.  Signaling states are plotted in color, while nonsignaling states are gray.  Radius of circles is proportional to the steady state density in that state, while graph edge width is proportional to the steady state flux between states.  Plot at the lower right shows the scaled estimator uncertainty as a function of energy consumed per binding event.  Color of the curves in the plot correspond to the color of the graph diagrams being represented.  Vertical line indicates the point on this plot corresponding to the current network graph diagrams.
